# Interval List Intersections

### Interval List Intersections

You are given two lists of closed intervals, firstList and secondList, where firstList[i] = [starti, endi] and
secondList[j] = [startj, endj]. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

A closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.
The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a
closed interval. For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].


### Exercise
Write a function, GetIntersection which returns the intersection of these two interval lists.
Write a test method which passes the supplied examples.
